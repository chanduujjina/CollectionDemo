this project for collection practice

1.What is an iterator?

to read or fetch the elements from the collection

1.using legacy for loop
2.using enhanced for loop

1.Fail fast iterator
2.Fail safe iterator

if the user performed multiple opearation on same time on collection it gives concurent modification exception

ArrayList
1.it follow array data structure
2.Fetching the elements from the collection is fast when compared with Linkedlist
3.It will implement random access interface
4.Manipulation of data(adding,updating,removal) is very slow in ArrayList
5.It won't allow insertion order
LinkedList:
1.It will follow double linkedlist data structure
2.Fetching the elements from the collection is slow when compared with ArrayList
3.It will implemtnt the Quee interface
4.Manipulation of data(adding,updating and removal of elements) is very fast in Linkedlist
5.It will follow the inserion order.

Tomarrow:
internal implementation of LinkedList

Few algos on LL
